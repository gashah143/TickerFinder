# TickerPerformanceFinder
Python script Reads ticker names from a CSV file, fetches performance data and saves it to a new CSV file with desired column names.
This script uses publicly available data, I have used Yfinance API.
in order to use the script create Ticker.csv file on windows machine, in the first column create column with title Ticker, then add tickers for which you want to get performance detaiils for 1 Day, 5 Dyas, 10 Days, 1 Month, 3 Month, 6 Months, Year to Date, 1 Year, 2 Years, 3 Years , 5 Years & 10 years.
Script will provide output in HTML file named as Performance.
